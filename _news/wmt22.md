My internship project at Amazon, [Embarrassingly Easy Document-Level MT Metrics](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.6.pdf), has been accepted at [WMT 2022](https://www.statmt.org/wmt22/) and was recently covered by [Slator](https://slator.com/converting-pre-trained-mt-metric-into-document-level-metric-amazon-study/)!
