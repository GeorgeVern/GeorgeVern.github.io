Happy to share that this week I started as an Applied Scientist Intern at AWS in Santa Clara, California! I will be working in the Amazon Translate team with [Prashant Mathur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgWJzakAAAAJ&hl=en), [Brian Thompson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IGa-LoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Hoang Cuong](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=Upkae34AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Marcello Federico](https://www.marcellofederico.net/)!
