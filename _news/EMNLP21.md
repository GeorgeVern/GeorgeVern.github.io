Happy to share that I have two papers accepted at [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/)!
- [Subword Mapping and Anchoring across Languages](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.224/) (findings)
- [Active Learning by Acquiring Contrastive Examples](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.51/) (main conf.)
