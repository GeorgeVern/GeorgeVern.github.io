I have been a teaching assistant in the [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/accueil) University in the following modules: 
* Analysis of Text Data (AnTeDe) (2024)
* Analysis of Text Data (AnTeDe) (2023)
* Analysis of Text Data (AnTeDe) (2022)

My responsibilities include weekly laboratory sessions where I assist students with Python, various libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, HuggingFace), and concepts regarding feature extraction, natural language processing, and deep learning.
