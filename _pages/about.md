Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Electrical Engineering department at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a research assistant at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), in Switzerland. My Ph.D. advisor is [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/). I am interested in (un)supervised machine translation and monolingual/multilingual language models. I also have a growing interest in active learning.

Before coming to Switzerland, I obtained my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) and my MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece. In my Master's thesis I worked on _Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models_ under the supervision of [Andreas Stafylopatis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/A.-Stafylopatis/1684529?sort=pub-date). I also spent 1.5 wonderful years working as a Machine Learning Engineer at the Greek startup [DeepSea Technologies](https://www.deepsea.ai/).
