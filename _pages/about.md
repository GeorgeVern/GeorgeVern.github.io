Hello! I am a first year Ph.D student at the Electrical Engineering department at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a Research Assistant at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), in Switzerland. My Ph.D advisor is [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/). I am interested in machine translation and monolingual or multilingual language models. I am also broadly interested in active learning.

Before coming to Switzerland, I obtained my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) and my MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the [National Technical University of Athens in Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece. In Master's I worked on _Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models_ under the supervisio of [Andreas Stafylopatis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/A.-Stafylopatis/1684529?sort=pub-date).
