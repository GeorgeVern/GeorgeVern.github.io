Hello! I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Electrical Engineering department at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a research assistant at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), in Switzerland. My Ph.D. advisor is [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/). I am interested in  machine translation and large language models. I also have a growing interest in machine translation evaluation.

During my Ph.D. I interned at Google in the [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) team in Zurich, Switzerland. I also did an internship at Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/)) in Santa Clara, CA, working with the Amazon Translate team.

Before coming to Switzerland, I obtained my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) and my MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning from the [National Technical University of Athens in Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece. In my Master's thesis, I worked on _Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models_ under the supervision of [Andreas Stafylopatis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/A.-Stafylopatis/1684529?sort=pub-date). During that time I was also working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [DeepSea Technologies](https://www.deepsea.ai/).
